# Fake Job Posting Detector

A Machine Learning + Deep Learning project that detects **fake job postings** based on textual job descriptions.  

The project is designed to simulate a **real-world ML workflow**:  
- Data preprocessing & visualization  
- Model training (BiLSTM)  
- API deployment with FastAPI  
- Basic frontend for user interaction

## Features
. Preprocessed job postings dataset with NLP techniques  
. Trained **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)** from scratch (no transfer learning)  
. Detects whether a job description is **Fake** or **Real**  
. Probability score included with predictions  
. Backend served with **FastAPI** (REST API)  
. Interactive API docs via **Swagger UI**  
. Frontend (HTML form) included for testing
